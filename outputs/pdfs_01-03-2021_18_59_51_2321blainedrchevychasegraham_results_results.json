If this a concern or there are indications of problems a plumber should be contacted to fully evaluate the piping and recommend repair or replacement. The temperature pressure relief (TPR) valve, at the upper portion of the water heater, is a required safety valve which should be connected to a drain pipe of proper size terminating just above floor elevation. The steam caused by a blow-off can cause scalding. Improper installations should be corrected. This area has seen numerous problems with pin hole leaks in copper pipes in recent years. While the reason has not been identified as of yet the problem occurs most often in homes over 40 years of age. Homes on well and septic systems should have the well water tested and the septic pumped if not pumped within the last year. Inspection of the septic system is beyond the scope of this inspection. Normally a septic system can go 3-5 years between pumping. Homes on well water with copper supply pipes should also have the water tested for acidity as the copper pipes can be corroded and need replacement if not properly protected. Testing water supply for quality and quantity are beyond the scope of this inspection. We have no way of determining when a well is going to fail to provide adequate water supply without potentially damaging the well pump.", "prediction": [{"relevancy": "relevant", "confidence": "100.0", "cause": "RELEVANCY_PREDICTION"}, {"classification": "plumbing", "confidence": "99.9"}, {"classification_secondary": "structure", "confidence": "0.1"}], "page": 19, "issuesAndRecommendations": [{"text": "They should be activated and tested prior to settlement", "reasons": ["CONTAINS_SHOULD_BE_RULE"]}, {"text": "If this a concern or there are indications of problems a plumber should be contacted to fully evaluate the piping and recommend repair or replacement", "reasons": ["CONTAINS_RECOMMEND_RULE", "CONTAINS_SHOULD_BE_RULE"]}, {"text": "The temperature pressure relief (TPR) valve, at the upper portion of the water heater, is a required safety valve which should be connected to a drain pipe of proper size terminating just above floor elevation", "reasons": ["CONTAINS_SHOULD_BE_RULE"]}, {"text": "Improper installations should be corrected", "reasons": ["CONTAINS_SHOULD_BE_RULE"]}, {"text": "Homes on well and septic systems should have the well water tested and the septic pumped if not pumped within the last year", "reasons": ["CONTAINS_SHOULD_HAVE_RULE"]}, {"text": "Homes on well water with copper supply pipes should also have the water tested for acidity as the copper pipes can be corroded and need replacement if not properly protected", "reasons": ["CONTAINS_NOT_PROPERLY_RULE"]}], "suppresses": [{"text": "PLUMBING Plumbing fixtures are operated in a normal manner during the inspection", "reasons": ["SUPPRESS_THE_INSPECTION_RULE"]}, {"text": "Under sink valves are not operated during the inspection as they tend to leak once operated or may not operate at all", "reasons": ["SUPPRESS_THE_INSPECTION_RULE"]}, {"text": "Water quality or hazardous materials (lead) testing is not part of the inspection however it is available from local testing labs", "reasons": ["SUPPRESS_THE_INSPECTION_RULE"]}, {"text": "All underground piping related to water supply, waste, or sprinkler use are excluded from this inspection", "reasons": ["SUPPRESS_THIS_INSPECTION_RULE"]}, {"text": "Inspection of the septic system is beyond the scope of this inspection", "reasons": ["SUPPRESS_THIS_INSPECTION_RULE"]}, {"text": "Testing water supply for quality and quantity are beyond the scope of this inspection", "reasons": ["SUPPRESS_THIS_INSPECTION_RULE"]}]}, {"text": "NOTE: Although the polybutylene water piping was only visible in the basement storage room, it may be present elsewhere in the house.", "prediction": [{"relevancy": "relevant", "confidence": "100.0", "cause": "RELEVANCY_PREDICTION"}, {"classification": "plumbing", "confidence": "97.8"}, {"classification_secondary": "hvac", "confidence": "1.6"}], "page": 19}, {"text": "NOTE: There are two Polybutylene water lines noted in the basement storage room.

Our inspection is performed from the equivalent of a 13' extension ladder. Multi story roofs are observed from the ground with binoculars, from windows in the house or using a camera. The attic is inspected to look for indications of roof leaks that may be current or happened in the past. In some cases we may not be able to observe all roof surfaces due to the height of the building, the ability to get far enough away from the roof to view the roof surfaces, restricted access (as on a flat roof with no access hatch), or weather conditions. In those cases we recommend further evaluation by a licensed roofer equipped with the necessary equipment to access these areas. Roofs are not dated, so the estimated age is based on typical life expectancy and current condition. The estimated age is only an estimate and is not necessarily the actual age of the roof covering.

This report is issued in consideration of the foregoing disclaimer. The only way to determine whether a basement is absolutely water tight is to observe it during a prolonged rainfall. Basement dampness is usually a result of surface water that is being incorrectly directed near the foundation. Many times the cure is no more than regrading, keeping gutters clean and extending downspouts away from the home. Sometimes water may be the result of a high water table, an under ground stream, or a spring. To repair underground water problems it is sometimes necessary to install a french drain and sump pump or even re-parge the exterior of the foundation wall in the effected areas. In our experience, most homes older than 20 years of age have had at least one instance of basement dampness at some point. It is not always possible to determine under what conditions and if water will enter a building, especially if the basement has been finished and surfaces painted in recent years. Some interior indications of moisture could be caused by water leaks within the house. When a house is offered for sale sometimes the signs of water entry into the basement or crawlspace have been covered by fresh paint or new trim and will not be observed by the inspector.

Gas piping in a building where CSST is being used is supposed to be bonded to the electrical ground or a separate ground, so it is better protected in the event of a lightning strike.

If that difference is about 5 milliamps or more, the circuit will trip, or disconnect. The GFCI actually assumes that if the current is not flowing in the neutral, it is flowing through something else, quite often a person.

This type of pipe is normally known to deteriorate from the inside outward. Some types of soil are corrosive to cast iron. Either point of corrosion may lead to pitting of the cast iron piping, and can eventually lead to pipe failure and leaking. Failure of the pipe under the slab can result in settling and cracking of the foundation. If the cracking and settling occurs towards the center and away from the perimeter of the slab foundation, the process of leveling and stabilizing the slab becomes more difficult and expensive. Thus, cast iron pipe represents a double concern to homeowners and potential home buyers; it results in the increased possibility of both future plumbing and foundation repair expenses. Plumbing repairs involving replacement of failing pipe under the slab foundation requires tunneling under the slab, which is expensive. But tunneling is also the preferred method of foundation piering. So it is important in cases of cast iron pipe failure to coordinate the work of the plumbing contractor with the work of foundation leveling contractor, so that they can coordinate the digging and use of the tunnels, thus reducing the overall cost of restoring the property. There is another solution. For pipes that are pitted, but are not yet indicating failure (they can still pass a hydrostatic test), a process exists for stabilizing the cast iron pipes in place. The technology is an adaptation of an industrial process that is scaled down and designed for residential applications. For a fraction of the cost of potential plumbing and foundation repairs, a homeowner can arrest the corrosion in its current state, and dramatically increase the life of the plumbing and the life of the foundation. Some providers of this cast iron stabilization process offer warranties on both the plumbing and the foundation.", "prediction": [{"relevancy": "relevant", "confidence": "100.0", "cause": "RELEVANCY_PREDICTION"}, {"classification": "plumbing", "confidence": "99.0"}, {"classification_secondary": "structure", "confidence": "0.9"}], "page": 145}, {"text": "Often times in older homes that have cast iron sewer laterals that have surface corrosion visible on the exterior, small cracks can not be easily seen.

Generally, GFCI outlets are installed within six feet of a sink, in bathrooms, in garages, and at exterior locations. If an outlet can be reached from a water source, a wet area, or an earth ground, you should use GFCI protection. Some motors have sufficient electrical losses to cause a GFCI to trip, so GFCI circuits generally should not be used for appliances with motors, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, disposals, etc. The GFCI works by sensing a difference in the flow of current from the hot wire through the neutral. If that difference is about 5 milliamps or more, the circuit will trip, or disconnect. The GFCI actually assumes that if the current is not flowing in the neutral, it is flowing through something else, quite often a person. A GFCI has a line side (incoming power) and a load side (outgoing power). The receptacle will not work if the incoming power is connected to the load side of the receptacle. Connect the incoming power to the line marked terminals and the continuation of the circuit (the next outlet) to the load terminals. The one GFCI will protect all of the following outlets connected in this way. Even if you don't have a continuation of the circuit, connect the power to the line side of the receptacle. GFCI outlets typically have a test button that should cause the circuit to trip.

The unique aspect of seeing surface temperature variances is that such variances can be caused by issues that may lie below the surface of a floor, behind a wall, or above a ceiling - places that are \"out of sight\" and are thus out-of-mind. Also, surface temperature variances can be caused by airflow such as cold air seeping under a door or warm air leaking from central air ducts. The air itself changes the surface temperature of objects that come in contact with the air. Surface temperatures can also be changed by living organisms such as mold, mildew and household pests.

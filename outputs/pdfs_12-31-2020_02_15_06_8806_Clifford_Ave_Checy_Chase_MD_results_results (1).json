In an ion alarm, ionized air molecules attach to the smoke particles that enter the chamber, reducing the ionizing current and triggering the alarm. Pros and Cons The ion detector reacts faster than the photoelectric in responding to flaming fires, and the photoelectric detector is more responsive to smoldering fires. Because an ion detector tests the air for small combustible particles, it can be fooled by chemical or paint particles in the atmosphere. The photoelectric detector, which needs to \"see\" the fire, can be fooled by dust, steam or even spider webs.

A photoelectric alarm is triggered when smoke enters the detector and light from a pulsating source is reflected off the smoke particles onto a light sensor. In an ion alarm, ionized air molecules attach to the smoke particles that enter the chamber, reducing the ionizing current and triggering the alarm. Pros and Cons The ion detector reacts faster than the photoelectric in responding to flaming fires, and the photoelectric detector is more responsive to smoldering fires. Because an ion detector tests the air for small combustible particles, it can be fooled by chemical or paint particles in the atmosphere. The photoelectric detector, which needs to \"see\" the fire, can be fooled by dust, steam or even spider webs.
